              <p>Hi! I am Santpal Singh Kalra. I didn't have much time to complete this page so I am just putting random stuff together to make up this webpage before the deadline.
                If you can't tell already I am a big fan of the Zelda Franchise. As you can see Mr. Reader this is not an ordinary portfolio. Even though i might not get selected I had quite a fun time making this.
                Oh by the way, did you try the 2nd and 3rd showcase buttons? If you generate a meme and then the copypasta, the meme disappears and, if you generate another meme after that, the copypasta disappears. Isn't that crazy?
                Anyways, I am a first year student in the CTech Department of SRMIST and I am not that familiar with copying syntax from MDN yet; still trying my best though. Don't forget to click on the button on the 4th Showcase(PS: It's definitely not a rickroll).
